# JKSApp
This project was created as a learning experience. I had a university project to create a database for a local club or business and created it for my local karate club.
My karate club then asked me to go further with the database and create an application for them.

I ended up creating this project. Due to limited knowledge on how to implement this on the internet at the time, the application is entirely offline. The database allows my karate club to view and manage members and other karate clubs affiliated with the same organization. It holds information about members, dojos, member affiliations, belts, qualifications and gradings with functionality for each. The applicaiton also contains basic functionality for printing reports.

*Important
The application is close to finished but still lacks error checking and polish.
